# Hacker News API test

## Requirements

- NPM (node package manager)
- Modern browser which supports es6 and css3

## How to set up

1. To bypass CORS policy errors, you'll need to run the app on a server. To run on localhost, we can use BrowserSync:
    `npm install -g browser-sync`

2. Once installed, navigate to the root of this repository and run: 
   `browser-sync start --server --files ./*`

3. This should launch the app in your browser, if not, the URLs should be printed in your terminal
